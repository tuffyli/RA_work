# RA_work

Code and (where permitted) documentation from my **Research Assistant** work.

> [!WARNING]
> **Repository status:** Not fully up to date.  
> I’m currently **translating code comments from Portuguese to English** and doing a light cleanup.  
> Expect inconsistencies and missing docs in the meantime.

## Contents

- **[Insper-Catedra-Ruth-Cardoso](./Insper-Catedra-Ruth-Cardoso/)**  
  Project folders and pipelines (DST, FUNDEF→FUNDEB, etc.). See each subfolder’s README for details.

---

## Data access

Some projects use **restricted/large datasets**. To keep this repo lean and compliant, it ships **code only** (plus occasional synthetic stubs).  
Place local data under a non-tracked folder (e.g., `data/`) and update paths in the scripts/configs.

---

## Notes

- Scripts may change as I finish the translation pass.  
- Issues/PRs that improve clarity or portability are welcome.
