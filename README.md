# RA_work

Code and (where permitted) documentation from my **Research Assistant** work.

> [!WARNING]
> **Repository status:** Not fully up to date.  
> I’m currently **translating code comments from Portuguese to English** and doing a light cleanup.  
> Expect inconsistencies and missing docs in the meantime.

## Contents

- **[Insper-Catedra-Ruth-Cardoso](./Insper-Catedra-Ruth-Cardoso/)**  
  Projects related to my RA work @Insper, in the [Catedra Ruth Cardoso chair](https://www.insper.edu.br/pt/pesquisa/catedras). Research mostly related to development economics, with a focus on education and early-childhood.

---

## Data access

Some projects use **restricted/large datasets**. To keep this repo lean and compliant, it ships **code only** (plus occasional synthetic stubs).  
Place local data under a non-tracked folder (e.g., `data/`) and update paths in the scripts/configs.

## Notes

- Scripts may change as I finish the translation pass.  
- Issues/PRs that improve clarity or portability are welcome.
